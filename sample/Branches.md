### **Branches**:

| Branch          | Purpose                                 | When to Use                                   | Merging Strategy                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **`main`**      | Stable, production-ready code          | For finished, stable code that's ready to deploy | Merge `release` into `main`.        |
| **`develop`**   | Integration of ongoing features        | To integrate and test new features and bug fixes | Merge feature branches into `develop`.       |
| **`release/*`** | Preparing code for a new release       | To finalize features, fix bugs, and prepare for deployment | Merge `release` into both `main` and `develop`. |

### **Git Flow**:

1. **Develop features in `develop`**: Work is done here, and feature branches are merged back into `develop`.
2. **Create `release` branch**: Once `develop` is ready for a new release, create a `release/*` branch to finalize and test.
3. **Merge `release` into `main`**: When the release is stable, merge it into `main` and tag the release.
4. **Merge `release` back into `develop`**: To keep `develop` up-to-date with any last-minute fixes made in the `release` branch.

### **Best Practices**:
- **Commit frequently** to keep changes manageable and avoid merge conflicts.
- Always **pull the latest changes** from the remote before merging to avoid issues.
- **Create clear, descriptive commit messages** to track what each change is for (e.g., "Fix bug in payment module" or "Finalize user login feature").
